# Wheelwright Framework

**Build AI wheels that roll forward forever.**

Your AI remembers everything. Every decision. Every insight. Every conversation.
Your wheel never stops rolling - it only grows smarter.

Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot - **any AI you use**.

## What is Wheelwright?

Wheelwright gives your AI assistants **perfect memory** across all your work sessions. Never lose context, never repeat explanations, always move forward.

**The beauty of Wheelwright:** Your AI partner remembers where you left off - whether you're brainstorming ideas, writing code, or shipping features. Switch between Claude, ChatGPT, or any LLM without losing a single detail. Your wheel keeps rolling.

### WAI Files - "This is the WAI"

WAI (pronounced "way") stands for **Wheelwright AI**.

Your Spoke-Project's `.WAI/` directory contains:
- **WAI-State.json** - Technical state, foundation, session tracking
- **WAI-State.md** - Strategic vision and evolution log
- **WAI-Guide.md** - Instructions for AI assistants
- **wheel-signals.jsonl** - High-impact learnings log

*"This is the WAI"* - The files that carry context forward. 🎯

---

## Token Efficiency: More Than Meets the Eye

**Wheelwright isn't just about going rogue with AI on your own - it's about being smarter, faster, and more efficient with your time and money.**

### The Problem: 50-80% Token Waste

Most AI-assisted development suffers from **premature implementation waste**:

```
You: "Add user authentication"
AI: *immediately writes 500 lines of code*
You: "Wait, I meant OAuth not JWT"
AI: *rewrites everything*
You: "Actually, use our existing auth service"
AI: *starts over again*

Result: 1,500+ tokens wasted, 2 hours lost, frustration high
```

**This is the #1 problem in long-running AI projects** - and it costs real money.

### The Solution: ADAPTIVE Workflow

Wheelwright automatically prevents token waste through **intelligent complexity assessment**:

**Complex Tasks** (multi-file OR >6 steps) → **STRICT Mode with Gates:**
1. **Discussion** - Explore requirements, alternatives, risks WITHOUT code
2. **Planning** - Get approval on structured plan BEFORE implementation
3. **Implementation** - Execute with automatic checkpointing

**Simple Tasks** (single file AND ≤5 steps) → **YOLO Mode:**
- AI proceeds autonomously
- No gates, maximum speed
- Retroactive logging

```
You: "Add user authentication"
AI: "I see several approaches. Let's discuss before implementing:
     - Option A: OAuth with existing provider
     - Option B: JWT with custom implementation
     - Option C: Integrate with your auth service
     Which aligns with the architecture?"

You: "Option C - use existing auth service"
AI: "Perfect. Here's the plan... [shows structured plan]"
You: "PLAN ACCEPTED"
AI: *implements correctly the first time*

Result: Zero rework, saves 1,000+ tokens, done in 30 minutes
```

### The Value: Time + Money

**Token efficiency means:**
- ✅ **50-80% fewer tokens** - Save real money on API costs
- ✅ **Zero rework cycles** - Get it right the first time
- ✅ **Faster completion** - Discussion → Plan → Done (no revisions)
- ✅ **Automatic checkpointing** - Large tasks pause every 3-5 steps for verification
- ✅ **Context compression** - `'Compact'` command keeps sessions lean

**Cost comparison:**
```
Without Token Efficiency:
- Feature implementation: ~15,000 tokens (with 2-3 rework cycles)
- Cost: ~$0.45 per feature (GPT-4)
- Time: 3-4 hours (including rework)

With Token Efficiency:
- Feature implementation: ~5,000 tokens (correct first time)
- Cost: ~$0.15 per feature (GPT-4)
- Time: 1 hour (no rework)

Savings per feature: $0.30 + 2-3 hours
Over 100 features: $30 saved + 200-300 hours saved
```

### How It Works: Automatic Intelligence

Wheelwright automatically assesses every request:

```python
# Behind the scenes on every user message:
files_affected = count_files_in_request()  # 1 file
estimated_steps = estimate_complexity()     # 3 steps

if files_affected >= 2 or estimated_steps >= 6:
    workflow_mode = "STRICT"  # Multi-stage gates required
else:
    workflow_mode = "YOLO"  # Autonomous, fast execution
```

**You don't configure anything** - AI automatically chooses the right mode based on complexity.

### Built-In Commands

During any session:
- **`'Time'`** - Check token usage estimate (warns at 80% capacity)
- **`'Compact'`** - Compress context, balance WAI files
- **`'Closeout'`** - Process session, auto-runs Compact
- **`'Shipit'`** - Closeout + git commit in one command

### Cross-Platform Consistency

Token efficiency works **identically** across all AI tools:
- ✅ Claude Code (via CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Cursor (via .cursorrules)
- ✅ VS Code Copilot/Continue (via settings.json)
- ✅ ChatGPT/Gemini/Generic (via AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**One framework, universal efficiency.**

### The Bottom Line

**Wheelwright = Session Continuity + Token Efficiency**

- **Session continuity** ensures AI never forgets your project
- **Token efficiency** ensures you never waste time or money

This isn't just about "AI memory" - it's about **intelligent, cost-effective AI partnership** that respects your time and budget.

### Understanding the Wheel

- **Hub** = Your centralized memory and project registry (stored at ~/wheelwright-hub/)
- **Spoke-Projects** (or **Spokes** for short) = Individual projects using Wheelwright (like your apps, research, writing projects)
- **Wheels** = The combination of your Hub and all Spoke-Projects working together
- **Spoke-Signals** = How a Spoke-Project tracks notable learnings (wheel-signals.jsonl)
- **Framework** = The Wheelwright source code (this repo)

**How they work together:** Your Hub discovers and tracks all your Spoke-Projects. Each Spoke signals important learnings back to the Hub. The Hub consolidates this knowledge and teaches all Spokes - raising all boats by raising the tide. This continuous "rolling" forward means your AI never forgets.

### About Wheelwright

**Wheelwright** is an AI context persistence system that makes project memory permanent.

**wheelwright-ai** is the GitHub organization hosting:
- Wheelwright Framework (this repo) - core tooling
- Extensions (VS Code, browser, etc.)
- Documentation and examples

**wheelwright.ai** is the project website and documentation hub.

All three work together under the "Wheelwright" umbrella.

### Key Features

- **Token Efficiency (50-80% savings)** - ADAPTIVE workflow prevents premature implementation waste. Complex tasks require Discussion → Planning → Approval gates. Simple tasks run autonomously. Saves time AND money.
- **Automatic Checkpointing** - Large plans pause every 3-5 steps for verification. No more runaway implementations. Stay in control.
- **Context Compression** - `'Compact'` command balances WAI files and compresses context. Keep sessions lean and efficient.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Framework

```bash
# Clone the framework repository
git clone https://github.com/wheelwright-ai/framework.git wheelwright
cd wheelwright

# Make the CLI executable
chmod +x WAI

# Optional: Add to your PATH for global access
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2: Initialize Your First Spoke-Project

Start by adding Wheelwright to an existing project (or create a new one):

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/my-awesome-project

# Initialize Wheelwright context
WAI init

# Or initialize from anywhere
WAI init ~/projects/my-awesome-project
```

This creates a `.WAI/` directory containing your project's memory:
- `WAI-State.json` - Machine-readable project state and foundation
- `WAI-State.md` - Human-readable strategic context and vision
- `WAI-Guide.md` - Instructions that teach AI assistants about your project
- `wheel-signals.jsonl` - High-impact learnings ready for Hub collection
- `kb-sync.json` - Hub synchronization status

### Step 3: Create Your Hub (After 1+ Spoke-Projects)

Once you have one or more Spoke-Projects, create a Hub to centralize learning:

```bash
# Create your personal Hub
WAI hub create

# Or specify a custom location
WAI hub create ~/wheelwright-hub
```

Your Hub becomes the central memory and registry for all your Spoke-Projects, enabling collective learning across everything you build.

## Using the Wheelwright CLI

The `WAI` command-line interface orchestrates your Hub, Spoke-Projects, and the Framework. Here's what it enables:

### Project Management
- **Initialize projects** - Add Wheelwright context to new or existing work
- **Check status** - View current wheel state, session info, and health metrics
- **Generate context** - Output formatted context for pasting into any LLM
- **Session closeout** - Prepare state files for session end with proper handoff

### Hub Operations
- **Create Hub** - Establish your centralized memory and project registry
- **Hub status** - Monitor Hub health, sync status, and connected Spoke-Projects
- **Locate Hub** - Find where your Hub lives on the filesystem
- **Project scanning** - Discover existing Spoke-Projects automatically
- **Bulk sync** - Synchronize all Spoke-Projects with the Hub at once

### Spoke System
- **List spokes** - View available capabilities (meta-consultation, document-analysis, code-review)
- **Add spokes** - Extend your wheel with specialized AI capabilities
- **Remove spokes** - Disable capabilities you no longer need

### Synchronization
- **Sync individual wheels** - Push Spoke-Signals to Hub, pull Hub learnings
- **Sync all wheels** - Update every Spoke-Project with latest Hub knowledge
- **Track sync history** - Monitor when and what was synchronized

### Command Glossary

## The Beauty of Session Continuity

### Before Wheelwright

```
You: "Let's add authentication to the app"
AI: "Sure! What kind of auth?"
You: "We discussed this yesterday - JWT with refresh tokens"
AI: "Okay, what database are you using?"
You: "PostgreSQL... like we've been using this whole project"
AI: "Got it. Should I use bcrypt for passwords?"
You: *sighs* "Yes, we already set that up in session 1..."
```

**Every new session = starting from scratch.**

### With Wheelwright

```
You: "Let's add authentication to the app"
AI: *reads .WAI/* "I see we're using PostgreSQL with bcrypt.
    Based on our architecture decisions (WAI-State.json:147),
    I'll implement JWT with refresh tokens as discussed.
    Should I follow the pattern we established in the user service?"
You: "Perfect."
```

**Every new session = picking up exactly where you left off.**

### What Makes This Magic?

1. **AI reads your wheel context** before responding
2. **Understands project foundation** - identity, boundaries, approach
3. **Sees decision history** - knows why things are the way they are
4. **Tracks evolution** - understands how the project has changed
5. **Learns from patterns** - applies Hub knowledge from your other projects
6. **Signals breakthroughs** - shares high-impact learnings back to the Hub

### Switch LLMs Without Friction

Start with Claude in the morning:
```bash
# Copy context for Claude
WAI context | pbcopy
```

Continue with ChatGPT in the afternoon:
```bash
# Same context, different AI
WAI context | pbcopy
```

**Both AIs see the same foundation, decisions, and progress.** Your wheel keeps rolling.

### From Idea to Implementation - One Continuous Memory

```
Session 1 (Ideation)
└─ AI helps brainstorm features
   └─ Records decisions in WAI-State.json

Session 2 (Planning)
└─ AI recalls Session 1 decisions
   └─ Proposes architecture
   └─ Updates evolution log

Session 3 (Development)
└─ AI knows the plan from Session 2
   └─ Writes code matching architecture
   └─ Signals breakthrough patterns to Hub

Session 4 (Different Project)
└─ AI applies Hub learnings from Session 3
   └─ Your wheel is teaching other wheels
```

**This is why we call it "rolling forward" - context never resets.**

---

## Automatic Discovery: The Critical Feature

**WAI must be seen and loaded automatically** - this isn't optional, it's what makes session continuity actually work.

### Why Automatic Discovery Matters

When you start an AI session in VS Code, Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI-powered IDE, the AI needs to **see your `.WAI/` folder immediately** - before you type a single prompt. Without this:

- ❌ AI starts with zero context
- ❌ You have to manually paste context every session
- ❌ Session continuity breaks down
- ❌ WAI becomes just another manual workflow

With automatic discovery:

- ✅ AI loads context before responding
- ✅ Understands project foundation from first message
- ✅ Applies Hub learnings automatically
- ✅ True session continuity - zero manual steps

### How AI Tools Discover WAI

Popular AI assistants automatically discover WAI through standard integration points:

#### Claude Code
```json
// Claude Code automatically reads project instructions
// Place instructions in: CLAUDE.md
// WAI templates include this by default

// Your CLAUDE.md points to .WAI/ folder:
"IMPORTANT: Read .WAI/ folder first to understand project context."
```

#### VS Code Extensions (Copilot, Codeium, etc.)
```json
// .vscode/settings.json - WAI creates this automatically
{
  "ai.context.files": [
    ".WAI/WAI-Guide.md",
    ".WAI/WAI-State.json",
    ".WAI/WAI-State.md"
  ],
  "ai.instructions": ".WAI/WAI-Guide.md"
}
```

#### Cursor IDE
```json
// .cursorrules - WAI generates on init
// Cursor automatically loads this file
// Contains: "Read .WAI/WAI-Guide.md for complete project context"
```

#### Windsurf, Zed, and Others
```markdown
// .ai/instructions.md or similar conventions
// WAI detects your IDE and creates appropriate files
// Standard pattern: Point to .WAI/ as source of truth
```

### The WAI Automatic Setup

When you run `WAI init`, the framework:

1. **Detects your environment** - VS Code? Claude Code? Cursor? Other?
2. **Creates integration files** - `.vscode/settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.
3. **Points AI to `.WAI/`** - Each integration file references `.WAI/WAI-Guide.md`
4. **Configures auto-loading** - AI tools read context on session start

### What Gets Loaded Automatically

When an AI tool starts a session in your project:

```
Session Start
    ↓
AI Tool Detects Integration File (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.)
    ↓
Reads .WAI/WAI-Guide.md
    ↓
Loads .WAI/WAI-State.json (foundation, decisions, constraints)
    ↓
Loads .WAI/WAI-State.md (strategic context, vision)
    ↓
Checks .WAI/kb-sync.json (Hub learnings available?)
    ↓
AI is now FULLY CONTEXT-AWARE before first response
```

### Verifying Automatic Loading

You can test if your AI tool is loading WAI correctly:

**Start a new session and ask:**
```
"What is this project about and what are the current boundaries?"
```

**If WAI is loading correctly, AI will respond with:**
- Project name and one-liner from `WAI-State.json`
- In-scope and out-of-scope boundaries
- Current phase and next actions
- Recent decisions and rationale

**If AI asks "What project?" → WAI isn't loading automatically** - check your integration files.

### Supported AI Tools

WAI auto-configures for:

| Tool | Integration File | Auto-Generated |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | ✅ Yes |
| **VS Code** (Copilot, Codeium, Continue) | `.vscode/settings.json` | ✅ Yes |
| **Cursor** | `.cursorrules` | ✅ Yes |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` | ✅ Yes |
| **Zed** | `.zed/settings.json` | ✅ Yes |
| **GitHub Copilot Workspace** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | ✅ Yes |
| **Aider** | `.aider.conf.yml` | ✅ Yes |
| **Web LLMs** | Use `WAI context` command | Manual copy |

### Manual Override (When Needed)

For AI tools not yet supported, you can manually configure:

```bash
# Generate context for copy/paste
WAI context

# Or create a custom integration file
echo "Read .WAI/WAI-Guide.md for project context" > .your-ai-tool-config
```

**The goal:** Every AI tool should load WAI automatically. If your tool isn't listed, [open an issue](https://github.com/wheelwright-ai/framework/issues) and we'll add support.

### The Wheel in Motion

1. **You work with AI** - Any LLM reads your `.WAI/` context
2. **AI updates state** - Session info, decisions, insights logged
3. **Signals flow to Hub** - High-impact learnings (impact >= 8) shared via `wheel-signals.jsonl`
4. **Hub learns and teaches** - Patterns consolidated, distributed to other Spoke-Projects
5. **All boats rise** - Your next project starts smarter because of this one

### Built-in Session Commands

During any AI session with Wheelwright, these commands optimize efficiency and continuity:

| Command | AI Response |
|---------|-------------|
| `'Time'` | Estimates token usage with 60%/80%/90% capacity warnings |
| `'Compact'` | Compresses context, balances WAI files (auto-runs before closeout/shipit) |
| `'Rules'` | Lists active behavioral guidelines and project protocols |
| `'Closeout'` | Runs Compact, processes session, extracts learnings, clears conversation log |
| `'Shipit'` | Runs Closeout + git commit in one command (ready for push) |

## Philosophy: AI as Responsible Partner

Wheelwright implements a unique **stewardship philosophy**:

> AI should enable but remain intentful. When work strays from the established
> foundation, the AI should detect drift and require explicit acknowledgment.

### Core Behaviors

1. **Detect Scope Drift** - Before enabling work, AI checks if it fits project boundaries
2. **Require Acknowledgment** - Direction changes need explicit user approval
3. **Complete Foundation First** - AI guides setup before diving into work
4. **Prefer Verification** - "Are you sure?" over silent compliance

### Why This Matters

Traditional AI assistants are **order-takers** - they do what you ask, even if it contradicts yesterday's decisions.

Wheelwright-enabled AI is a **responsible partner** - it remembers the plan, detects when you're drifting, and asks "Are you sure this aligns with our foundation?"

**Result:** Less wasted effort, more intentional evolution, better outcomes.

## Migrating from SCF

If you used the Session Continuity Framework (SCF), migration is straightforward:

```bash
# Run the migration script
python migrate-scf-to-wheelwright.py

# Rename your SCF hub
mv ~/scf-hub ~/wheelwright-hub

# Update environment variables
sed -i 's/SCF_HUB_PATH/WHEELWRIGHT_HUB_PATH/g' ~/.bashrc
```

The migration preserves all context, decisions, and learnings.
