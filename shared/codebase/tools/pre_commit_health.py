"""
Pre-commit health gate for WAI spokes.

Runs a quick health check and exits non-zero if critical drift is detected.
Designed to be fast (<100ms) and catch only FAIL-level findings.

Also runs security_scan on changed prompt/teaching files to catch injection patterns.

Usage:
  python3 tools/pre_commit_health.py          # check current dir
  python3 tools/pre_commit_health.py /path     # check specific spoke

Exit codes:
  0 = healthy (or no WAI-Spoke found — not a WAI project)
  1 = drift detected — fix before committing
